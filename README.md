## PyCitySchools
The data analyzed in this repository includes both school and student data from two smaller documents, which were able to be merged by 'school_name' into a single, updated document. By using pandas in Jupyter Notebook, I was able to create multiple dataframes that help analyze the data by different factors present:
* School Summary 
    (add chart)
* Top Performing Schools (% Overall Passing)
    (add chart)
* Worst Performing Schools (% Overall Passing)
    (add chart)
* Math Scores by Grade
    (add chart)
* Reading Scores by Grade
    (add chart)
* Scores By School Spending
