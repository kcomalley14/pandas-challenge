## PyCitySchools
The data analyzed in this repository includes both school and student data from two smaller documents, which were able to be merged by 'school_name' into a single, updated document. By using pandas in Jupyter Notebook, I was able to create multiple dataframes that help analyze the data by different factors present:
* School Summary 
    (add chart)
* Top Performing Schools (% Overall Passing)
    (add chart)
* Worst Performing Schools (% Overall Passing)
    (add chart)
* Math Scores by Grade
    (add chart)
* Reading Scores by Grade
    (add chart)
* Scores By School Spending
    (add chart)

Two trends that can be found in the data:
1. Schools with less than 2000 students show have much higher scores for reading and math, which also correlate to better overall passing rates than larger schools over 2000 students.
2. District schools also see much worse scores than charter schools. The data shows that district schools are getting more money per student than charter schools, but still have lower scores overall. So putting more money into the district schools for students doesn't seem to show a positive effect on scores.
